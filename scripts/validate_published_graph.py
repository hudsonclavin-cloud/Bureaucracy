"""Release gate for the published graph.

Reads output/graph.json (or a path given as the first argument) and exits
nonzero if any node asserts more than its evidence supports. This runs over the
real artefact rather than a fixture, which is the only way it could have caught
the three validator failures of this week: each one produced a plausible number
and passed its own unit tests.

The gate never writes. Run it before every push that touches output/.
